Many developers face a big issue when developing paid software. This major issue is piracy. Many upcoming developers that I know spend hundreds of hours
trying to develop high quality software and make some money. While many have been successful, they have lost hundreds of dollars in revenue
due to illegal redistribution of paid software. This plugin verification website aims to combat that issue. developers can now upload paid
software to this site and release there software with authentication keys. The website signs software and ensures that a developers software does not
get stolen. Keys will activate software only once. developers may create activation keys for their software and revoke them as needed.
