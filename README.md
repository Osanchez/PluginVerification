# The Issue
Many developers face a big issue when developing paid software. This major issue is piracy. Many upcoming developers that I know spend hundreds of hours
trying to develop high quality software and make some money. While many have been successful, they have lost hundreds of dollars in revenue
due to illegal redistribution of paid software. This plugin verification website aims to combat that issue. 

# How it works
developers can now upload paid software to the site and release software with authentication keys. The website signs software and ensures that a developers software does not get redistributed. Keys will activate software only once. activation keys are automatically generated once software a copy is sold. developers have the option of revoking keys as needed.
